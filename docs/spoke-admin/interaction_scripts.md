# Interaction Scripts

Interaction scripts define a campaign's conversation flow and
survey questions. They are used by texters to send prepared
scripts to contacts and to record responses to survey. Each
campaign has an interaction script that can be written and
edited on the campaign settings page. Only administrators can
edit interactions scripts.

##### *An interaction script has three parts:*

1. An initial message that a texter sends out to all contacts
   to start a conversation
2. A set of survey questions and answers that texters use to
   record information about the conversation
3. A set of follow-up messages that correspond with those
   survey answers and that can vary depending on how a contact
   replies

If a conversation departs from the interaction script, you can
provide [canned responses](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/canned-responses) that texters use to handle the situation on a case-by-case basis.
