# Spoke 101 Tips For A Successful Mass Text

If you need help getting started, click [here](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/build-a-campaign) to read about how to build a campaign. Once you have created a
draft campaign, check to make sure your campaign meets the following
characteristics to make sure your messages are delivered and not
filtered as spam.

**What is spam filtering?**

When your texts leave Spoke, they travel through a chain of
other channels before arriving at someone's cell phone. At
any stop along the way, your message can be deemed spam and thus
not delivered.

  

How can you make sure to construct a message that will reach
your audience?

* **Use short-links.** Commonly used short
  links (e.g., bit.ly, tinyurl.com, etc.) as well as commonly
  used link domains (e.g., ActBlue) are OFTEN blocked as spam.
  We recommend using a custom domain on [Rebrandly](https://www.rebrandly.com/). See our full article [here](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/short-link-domains) for more info.
* **Introduce yourself.**Greet the textee and
  identify who you are and from what organization you're
  texting. This could look like "Hey
  `{firstName}`, `{texterFirstName}` here
  with With the Ranks!"
* **End your message with opt out language.** 'Reply
  STOP to quit' is a safe bet. We also like (STOP to End).
  This is crucial for deliverability.
* **Ensure grammar and punctuation are correct.**
  Messages with incorrect grammar are likely to be filtered out.

MMS checklist:

* **Is the image under 600kb?** Images above 600kb
  in size will not deliver to many cell phones.
* **Make sure the link is a link directly to the image** and ends in .jpeg, .png, or .gif.
* **Put your image link in square brackets to send MMS.**There should not be a space between the
  brackets and the initial text, so there is no odd space
  at the beginning of your message.

    

  To review, an MMS initial message should look like the
  following:
