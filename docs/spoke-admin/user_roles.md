# User Roles

Types of Roles
--------------

Spoke has four roles, each with different levels of permissions.
You can access and edit these roles from the
**People** page of the administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards).

### Texter

A
 *texter* is a member of your organization, often a volunteer,
who is able to text contacts in a campaign. Texters use the texter
[dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards) to request conversation assignments and send messages.

Texters are responsible for sending initial messages and
responses to contacts, as well as answering survey questions as
the conversation progresses. Marking survey data is an essential
part of keeping a contact list up-to-date, and sets you up for
more tailored conversations in future texting campaigns.

### Supervolunteer

A
*supervolunteer* has partial access to the administration
dashboard. They can help review and reassign conversations in Message
Review, as well as help approve requests from the Assignment Requests
page. Supervolunteer accounts have the same ability as texters
to request conversations and text contacts.

### Admin

An
*administrator* (or *admin*) is a member of
your organization who can create, modify, and manage
campaigns and who has expanded access to
the administration dashboard. Administrator accounts
have the same ability as texters to request conversations
and text contacts.

### Owner

An
*owner* has full access to the [organization](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/organizations) and may manage organization settings, shortlink domains, and
bulk operations. They have full access to the administration
dashboard. Owner accounts have the same ability as texters
to request conversations and text contacts.
