# Change User Roles

User roles can be changed from the
**People** page of the administration dashboard.
After you [invite texters](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/invite-texters-to-spoke) to join your Spoke organization and they create an account, they
will automatically be listed with the default **Texter** role.

##### *To change a user's role:*

1. Navigate to the **People**page within
   the administration dashboard.
2. Click "Texter" to reveal a dropdown menu of roles.
3. Select a new role. For more information about the different
   user roles, see [user roles](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/user-roles).
