# Create Interaction Script

The interaction script is where you determine the structure
and message of your campaign.

#### *To create an interaction script:*

1. Select your campaign from the **Campaign** page of
the administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

2. Select the **Interactions**window from the
campaign settings page.

3. Write an initial message that will be sent to all of your
campaign contacts:

* Click the **Script Version 1**field.
* Enter an initial message; use dynamic script as appropriate,
  for example, you may want to begin with something like, "Hi
  { firstName }, it's {texterFirstName}
  with..." As of 2022, you will need to include opt out
  language like "**Reply STOP to opt out**" at
  the end of your message to ensure deliverability.
* Click **Done**.
* Click the **Question** field and write a survey
  question. You must have a survey question to add survey responses.
  Only texters can see the survey question.

4. Create survey responses for your texters to navigate their
conversations:

* Click the **Add a Response**button.
* Click the **Answer**field and write an answer
  to your previous survey question. Texters will be able to
  select this survey answer to log data and access the
  prepared response script. Only texters see the survey answer
  itself; contacts will only see the script.
* Click the **Script Version 1** field.
* Enter a survey response script that will automatically
  populate when a texter selects the survey answer.
* Click **Done**.
* If you include an additional question in your survey
  response script, you can add a new survey question by
  clicking the **Question**field and writing a new question.

5. Repeat step 4, adding survey responses to the question posed
in your initial message. If you include additional questions
under these survey response, make sure to add survey responses
nested under those questions as well.

6. Click  **Save**.

> Note #1: When building campaigns with multiple survey questions,
> make sure you are adding responses under the appropriate
> question. You can use
> [Script Preview](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/114-script-preview) to double-check your work and easily view your question and response
> trees.

> *Note #2: You are able to write multiple versions of any
> survey script; these are then randomly distributed across
> conversations. This can be a way to a/b test different
> messages or to minimize the chance your texts are flagged as
> spam by cell carriers*

> *Note # 3: When writing a script, you can see the
> estimated number of segments per text message, as well* *as the number of characters left in the current segment.
> This can help you estimate the* [cost](https://politicsrewired.com/pricing/) *of your campaign.*
