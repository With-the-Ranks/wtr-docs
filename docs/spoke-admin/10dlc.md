# 10DLC

**10DLC** (short for 10 Digit Long Code) is a policy
from cell phone carriers for organizations that use software to send
text messages. The 10DLC scheme requires organizations to register
with cell phone carriers and describe their usage before using software
like Spoke to send text messages.

**Please see [Adopting 10DLC](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/transitioning-to-10dlc) to start the registration process.**

We are committed to supporting you throughout the registration
process, and offer registration and ongoing 10DLC enrollment at
no additional cost. Contact us at any time at

### History and background

Before the development of 10DLC, cell phone carriers discouraged
organizations from using software to send messages from local
phone numbers (in carrier jargon: long codes) to other local
phone numbers. Carriers pushed organizations to instead purchase
[short code numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code)
or [toll-free numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-free_telephone_number), which required lengthy and expensive setup procedures and
opt-in procedures.

In the 2010s, software was developed to avoid these extensive
setup costs and procedures. Instead of sending messages from
short-code or toll-free numbers, this software provided ways to
send text messages from individual cell phones to other cell
phones. This concept, known as peer-to-peer texting, allowed
political campaigns and organizers to quickly contact voters and
volunteers. Eventually, this ecosystem developed into modern
texting software, which allows users to directly send text
messages via internet telecom services without managing
individual cell phones.

The advent of software-based texting lowered technical and
financial barriers for sending texts, leading to an increase in
spam. In response, cell phone carriers introduced the 10DLC
policy to provide a sanctioned platform for organizations to
send text messages using long codes. The stated objective of the
10DLC program is to protect consumers from unwanted spam while
still allowing businesses to connect with their customers.

Starting in 2025, carriers will completely block all
unregistered long code traffic. Organizations must register
themselves as a 10DLC brand, and all messages sent on 10DLC
channels will be associated with this brand. This registration
costs money and deanonymizes message traffic, increasing the
risk to spammers.
