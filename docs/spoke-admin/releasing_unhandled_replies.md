# Releasing Unhandled Replies

Once you've built and launched a campaign and all your initial
messages have been sent, you may want to consider periodically
releasing unhandled replies from inactive texters and making
them available to active texters via the [request form](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form). It's easy for texters to forget to check their workflows
regularly enough to make sure they are promptly responding to
all of their assigned contacts. Releasing unhandled replies
allows you to ensure that the people you're texting aren't
waiting too long to get a response!

> **Note:**Make sure you're familiar with
> [auto-assignment](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment) before reading this article. You will need to be using auto-assignment
> for releasing unhandled replies to work properly.

There are two ways to release unhandled replies: manually or
automatically.

### Manually Releasing Unhandled Replies

#### Across All Campaigns

To release unhandled replies across *all*of your
campaigns simultaneously, go to the **Campaigns**page of your administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards) and click the **Release Unhandled Replies**button
in the top right hand corner.

You'll then be prompted to choose how long conversations much
have been idle for in order to qualify for being released. For
example, if you select 1 hour, then only conversations that have
been waiting at least an hour for a response will be released to
the [request form](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form), while newer conversations will remain in their existing
texters' workflows. This ensures that active texters are not
getting their conversations taken away while they're still
working on them! When you're ready to move forward, click
the **Release** button.

#### One Campaign at a Time

To release unhandled replies on just one campaign, go to
the **Campaigns** page of your
administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards) and select the three vertical dots to the right of the campaign
in question to pull up the menu of [campaign actions](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/59-campaign-actions), then select **Release Unreplied Conversations**. Again, you'll be prompted to choose how long
conversations much have been idle for in order to qualify for
being released. Choose a time and click **Execute Operation**.

### Automatically Releasing Unhandled Replies

To automatically release unhandled replies to the [request form](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form), go to the campaign editor page of the campaign in question
and open the **Autoassign Mode**window, then toggle
the *second*switch on. Again, this will prompt to
choose how long conversations much have been idle for in
order to qualify for being released. But in this case, Spoke
will *automatically*release unhandled replies according
to that time interval for as long as the toggle is turned on.
When you're ready, click **Save**.

This option can be helpful if you want to prioritize making sure
your contacts get responded to as quickly as possible and when
it's not important for the same texter to be interacting with
the same contact for the duration of the conversation.

However, using this option means you'll have little real-time
information about how many replies you have at any one moment,
because they'll constantly be getting automatically unassigned.
Also, texters may not like getting their replies so promptly
taken away. If you're new to using [auto-assignment](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment), we recommend starting by manually reassigning your
unhandled replies and getting a feel for things before
experimenting with automatically releasing them.
