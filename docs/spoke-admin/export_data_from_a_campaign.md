# Export Data From A Campaign

Every campaign has two sets of data associated with it: campaign
data and message data.

1. Export
   **campaign data** to accessÂ your updated contact list, complete with their
   conversation statuses and survey responses. Every row will be
   a contact.
2. Export **message data** to get a breakdown of every message that was sent or received,
   including whether or not it was successfully delivered. Every
   row will be a message.

##### *To export data from a campaign:*

1. Open a campaign from the **Campaigns** page  
      
   > Note: If the campaign has not started, the campaign
   > settings page opens. To open the campaign page, remove
   > "edit" from the URL.
2. Click **Export Data**. This starts the export
   process.
3. Open your email, and wait for a message from Spoke Rewired.
   Exporting campaign data can take a long time, depending on
   the amount of data. Check your spam folder if you haven't
   received an email in a reasonable amount of time.
4. Click the first link to download the **campaign data**.
5. Click the second link to download the **message data**.
