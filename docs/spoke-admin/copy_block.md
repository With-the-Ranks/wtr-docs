# Copy Block

When you're
[creating an interaction script](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/43-create-interaction-script) for your campaign, you can easily copy and paste script blocks
within or between campaigns. This can be helpful if you want to add
generic survey scripts you already have written elsewhere (e.g.,
Wrong Number) or if you're building multiple complex survey trees
within a single campaign, each with the same or similar structure
and content.

##### *To copy and paste a script block:*

1. Navigate to the campaign that contains the script block you
wish to copy.

2. Open the
**Interactions**window within the campaign
settings page.

3. Click the
**Copy Block**button within the script block you
wish to copy.

4. Navigate to the campaign within which you want to paste the
copied block. If you're copying and pasting in the same
campaign, just stay where you are!

5. Find the survey question that your copied block will be
answering and click the **+ Paste Block**button immediately underneath the script block that
contains the survey question. The copied script block will
appear immediately below the survey question.

> Note #1: You can copy and paste entire survey trees (i.e., a
> script block with a survey question and all the the script
> blocks with survey answers nested underneath it) by copying the
> parent script block containing the survey question. When you
> paste the block, it will cary over not only the parent script
> block, but also all of its "children" blocks nested beneath it.

> *Note #2: If you wish to replace the entire Interactions
> script with that of another campaign, first click **Copy Block**on the initial message of the campaign you want to
> copy, then select****+ Paste Block**within the initial message
> script block of the campaign you want to replace. You may
> also want to consider simply* [making a copy](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/112-copy-a-campaign) *of the campaign you wish to replicate.*
