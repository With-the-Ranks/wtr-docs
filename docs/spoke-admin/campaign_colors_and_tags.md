# Campaign Colors And Tags

The campaign list on the administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards) uses colors and tags to help you keep track of your active campaigns.
The colors and tags are automatically applied to the campaigns based
on their state.

Color Coding
------------

Active campaigns in the campaign list are categorized by the
color of their titles. They are color-coded as follows:

* **Orange** -- The campaign has not been started,
  or it has unassigned contacts.
* **Blue** -- The campaign has been started but not
  all initial messages have been sent.
* **Green** -- The campaign has been started and all
  initial messages have been sent.

Tags

Active campaigns in the campaign list can have one or more of
the following tags:

* **Unassigned Contacts** -- Some contacts have not
  been assigned to texters.
* **Unsent Initial Messages** -- Some contacts have
  not received an initial text.
* **Unhandled Replies** -- Some contacts have not
  received a reply from a texter.
* **Autoassign Eligible** -- The campaign has auto-assignment
  mode enabled.
