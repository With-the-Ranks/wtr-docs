# Message Review

The Message Review page of your administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards) allows you to filter through your organization's conversations,
as well as reassign or unassign conversations that you've selected.

Message Filter
--------------

Within the Message Review page, click open the **Message Filter** window. You can then use the available filtering criteria to find
and review specific conversations. Once you select your filtering
criteria, a list of conversations will automatically generate based
on that selection. As you update your criteria, the list will also
update in real time.

> Note: Try and start with criteria selections that will narrow
> the breadth of your search so that the system doesn't get
> stalled trying to generate an unwieldy list. For example,
> filtering by campaign or texter is often a good place to start.

#### Filtering Criteria - Toggles

There are numerous toggles you can switch ON or OFF to help
filter conversations.

* **Active Campaigns:** select whether or not you
  want to display conversations from active campaigns.
* **Archived Campaigns:** select whether or
  not you want to display conversations from
  archived campaigns.
  + *The default position is OFF, so that you'll
    only be looking at conversations from active
    campaigns. You may need to turn this ON if you
    want to review conversations from older
    campaigns.*
* **Not Opted Out:** select whether or not
  you want to display conversations from contacts who have not
  opted out.
* **Opted Out:** select whether or not you
  want to display conversations from contacts who have opted
  out.
  + *The default position is OFF, so that you'll
    only be looking at conversations with contacts
    who are still opted in. This can be helpful to
    toggle ON if you're looking to make sure your
    texters are not incorrectly opting people out.*
* **Include Escalated:** select whether or
  not you want to display escalated conversations.
  + *The default position is ON. Make sure to turn
    it OFF if you're going to be bulk reassigning or
    unassigning conversations, so that you don't
    mistakenly remove escalated conversations from
    the escalated convos workflow.*

#### Filtering Criteria - Fields

There are also a number of drop-down and search fields you can
use to filter conversations.

* **Contact Message Status:**decide which
  conversations to review based on the status of those
  conversations. One or multiple of the following statuses may
  be selected:
  + *All*– Conversations of all statuses.
  + *Needs Texter Response* – Conversations where
    the contact has replied but not yet received a response
    from a texter.
  + *Needs First Message* – Conversations where the
    contact has not yet received the initial message.
  + *Active Conversations* – Conversations where the
    the contact has replied and the texter has responded.
  + *First Message Sent*– Conversations where the
    initial message has been sent but the contact has
    not replied.
  + *Closed*– Conversations where the texter has
    selected [Close](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/80-skip-a-reply), effectively closing the conversation.
* **Campaign:**filter conversations by campaign
  name or ID number. This is often the first step when
  searching for specific conversations.
* **Texter:** filter conversations by texter name.
  This if usually the first step when searching for conversations
  in a specific texter's workflow.
* **Filter by Contact Name:**filter conversations
  based on the name of the contact being texted.
* **Filter by Contact Tags:** filter conversations
  based on tags that have been applied to those conversations.

Message Actions
---------------

Once you've generated a filtered list of conversations, you're
then able to perform actions on one, several, or all of those
filtered conversations. There are two available actions:

#### Reassign

Reassigning conversations removes them from their current
texter's workflow and places them in a new texter's
workflow.

##### *To reassign conversations:*

1. Use **Message Filter**to generate a filtered
   list.
2. Click **Message Actions**, then select **Reassign**.
3. Click the **Select at least one texter**field
   and pick one or more texters to receive the reassigned
   texts. If you select multiple texters, the reassigned
   messages will be evenly split between them.
4. Select one or more conversations to reassign using the
   checkboxes, then click**Reassign Selected**. Or, if you want to reassign the entire filtered list,
   click **Reassign All x Matching**, then select **Reassign**.

#### Unassign

Unassigning conversations removes them from their current
texter's workflow and places them in the pool of texts available
for assignment via the [request form](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form).

##### *To unassign conversations:*

1. Use **Message Filter** to generate a
   filtered list.
2. Click **Message Actions**, then
   select **Unassign**.
3. Select one or more conversations to unassign using the
   checkboxes, then click **Unaassign Selected**.
   Or, if you want to unassign the entire filtered list, click **Unassign All x Matching**, then select **Unassign**.

> Note: Once you generate a filtered list, you can review
> individual conversations by clicking the box below the
> **View Conversation** column. From that view,
> you can see all messages that have been exchanged and all survey
> answers that have been selected for that conversation. You are
> also able to send additional messages, edit survey answers,
> manage tags, and opt out or un-opt out contacts. You can toggle
> to other conversations in your list using the navigation left
> and right arrows.
