# Manage Assignment Control

The **Assignment Control** page on the administration
dashboard allows you to manage the [request form](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form) that distributes texting [assignments](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/33-text-assignment) to you texters. Assignment controls can be applied to all of your
texters via the "General" designation, or to specific teams of texters.

There are three primary assignment controls:

**1. Enable Assignment:**Toggling the "Enable
assignment?" switch will make assignments available to texters
via the request form from any active campaigns that have [autoassign](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form) enabled.

unsent initial messages or unhandled replies to the request
form.

* *Unsent Initial Messages:*conversations where the contact has not yet received an
  initial message.
* *Unhandled Replies:* Conversations where the the contact has responded to
  a message and is awaiting a reply.

conversations that a texter can request per assignment.

* *Unsent Initial Messages:*We typically recommend setting your max limit for
  initial messages between **100-1000**. It's safer to start smaller so new texters are not
  overwhelmed by replies, though most will find assignments of
  500+ messages to be manageable.
* *Unhandled Replies:*We typically recommend
  setting your max limit for unhandled replies between **10-30**. Setting small maximum limits for replies will encourage
  texters to take their time, apply accurate survey responses,
  and customize scripts, while large max limits may encourage
  more rushed and robotic responses.

The final setting you'll see in Assignment Control is for **custom escalation tags**. Adding custom escalation tags to a specific team enables
texters who are part of that team to apply those custom tags
while texting. For more information, please read about [conversation tags](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/67-conversation-tags)
