# Copy A Campaign

You can copy an existing campaign as a way to create a new
campaign with the same or a similar
[interaction script](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/38-interaction-scripts). This is often the faster and easier way to create a new
campaign.

##### *To copy a campaign:*

1. Select the campaign you wish to copy from the
**Campaigns** page of the administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

2. Click the 
**Copy Campaign**button. You should see a pop-up
message stating that the campaign successfully copied.

Your copied campaign will then appear at the bottom of your
**Campaigns**page with the word "COPY" at the start
of the campaign title.
