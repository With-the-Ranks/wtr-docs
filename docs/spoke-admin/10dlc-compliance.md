# 10DLC Compliance

All organizations sending messages with Spoke must register for 10DLC. Carriers may levy the following types of fees for non-compliance with 10DLC messaging requirements:

## Content Violation

T-Mobile may charge a $10,000 fee for each unique instance of content violation by a sender. Content violations are usually **SHAFT violations** (Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco) but also include spam messages or phishing attempts. 

We are not especially worried about this type of content being sent by the customers we have chosen to work with. However, it is very important that all texting program directors familiarize themselves with these violation types!

## Message Routing

Additional fees are assessed for message routing violations on the network. It is believed that these fees will not impact you as a customer.

If, however, we find that you have intentionally circumvented the safeguards built into our software and incurred any fees as a result of such action, we will pass on any message routing non-compliance fees.
