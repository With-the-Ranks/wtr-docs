# Auto Assignment

You can utilize
**auto assignment** to easily and automatically distribute
texting assignments to your texters, without needing to manually
divide texts or replenish assignments when texters run out of messages.
This keeps texts flowing to texters who are able to send more messages
without overburdening administrators with tedious assignment and
reassignment tasks.

There are three steps to set up auto assignment for a campaign:

**1. Enable Auto Assignment:** 
Click on the **Autoassign Mode** tab at the bottom of
your campaign settings page, then toggle the top switch to enable
autoassign.

![The autoassign section is a tab at the bottom of the campaign settings page. When autoassign is turned on, the top switch in this section will be green.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/5fc9400b4664bd7a123ea853/file-FVKPtDqJ8t.png)
> **Note:** Toggling the bottom switch will automatically
> release unhandled replies to the
> [request form](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/request-form) after a pre-set period of time (for example, 30 minutes). This
> can be a helpful feature down the road, but if you're just learning
> how to manage auto assignment, we recommend keeping if toggled off.

**2. Turn on the Request Form:** 
Click [**Assignment Control**](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/manage-assignment-control)
on the administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards), then toggle the switch to enable assignment. Set the
assignment type (initials or replies) and the maximum number of
messages a texter can request per assignment. This will activate
the [request form](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/request-form) for your texters, allowing them to request assignments.

**3. Set Up** **Auto-Approval:** Click **Settings** on the administration dashboard, then select **Auto Approve** beneath "Default Text Request Auto-Approval Level." This will make
it so that when texters request an assignment via the request form,
that assignment is automatically approved in a matter of seconds.
If you wish to have administrators or [Supervolunteers](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/6-user-roles) manually approve requests, you can set this option to
**Approval Required**. We recommend using Auto
Approve in most cases.

> **Note:** You only need to set Auto Approve as your
> default setting once. Once set, all future texters invited to your
> organization will be set to have their assignments automatically
> approved. However, changing the default setting does not change the
> auto-approval level of texters already in your organization. You
> can change this setting on an individual basis by going to the
> **People** window within the administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

![The "Default Text Request Auto-Approval Level" setting is in the General settings section which is marked by a gear symbol.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/5fc6a179d580ce55a38b3410/file-jKIfkJUxR2.png)
