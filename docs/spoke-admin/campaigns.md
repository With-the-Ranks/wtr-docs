# Campaigns

Campaigns are the central feature of Spoke. They provide the
structure and tools for [texters](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/user-roles) to engage in conversations with your contacts.

Each campaign has a contact list and an interaction script. When you start a campaign, contacts are assigned to texters,
who can then initiate a conversation using the interaction
script.

A campaign should have a clear and specific purpose, for
example, asking contacts to attend an event or identifying their
level of support for a candidate. This will allow you to
communicate clearly with your contacts and for texters to
collect consistent data based on how contacts reply.

You can run multiple campaigns simultaneously to reach different
contacts about different things.

If you are a Spoke administrator, you can manage campaigns from
the administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards).
