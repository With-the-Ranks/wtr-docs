# Invite Texters To Spoke

You can invite new texters to join your organization on Spoke by
sending them an invitation link. When someone clicks on the
link, they'll be prompted to create a new texter account. After
a texter creates their account, you can [change their user role](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/35-change-user-roles) as needed.

##### *To invite texters to join your organization:*

1. From the administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards), navigate to the **People** page.
2. Click the greenÂ **plus (+)**button in the bottom right-hand corner.
3. Copy the URL.
4. Share the URL with the texter(s) you want to invite. When
   someone clicks on the link, they will be able to create an
   account.

> Note: This URL is unique to your Spoke
> [organization](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/79-organizations). It will now allow texters to join other organizations and
> texters already from another organization will not be able to
> join yours unless they're given the unique link.
