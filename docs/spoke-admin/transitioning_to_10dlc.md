4. Note: Customers that signed up for our service before
   October 1st, 2021 may need to sign the newest contract if
   they have not already. We will email your account owner the
   new contract. The updated service agreement covers 10DLC
   changes, including [10DLC Pricing and Compliance](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/129-10dlc-pricing). We will not register a [brand](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/131-10dlc-glossary) or campaign on your behalf until the updated service agreement
   has been signed and we have the required brand registration information.

We anticipate a 3-5 business day delay between completing the
registration and your brand being capable of sending messages.
