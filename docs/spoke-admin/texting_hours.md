# Texting Hours

Texting hours restrict when [texters](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/user-roles) can send messages to contacts. Using texting hours minimizes the
chance of disturbing someone at inappropriate hours of the day. Spoke's
default texting hours have been chosen to comply with regulations
regarding consumer telephone contact. **We do not recommend extending these hours** and you do so at your own risk.

Texting hours are defined in the [campaign settings page](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/34-create-a-campaign) by a start time, an end time, and a default time zone. The time
zone for a contact is determined by their zip code. If a contact
does not have a zip code, the default time zone is used.

Outside of texting hours, Spoke disables the **Send** and **Send Replies** buttons in the texter's workflow.
If you try to send a message outside of the designated texting hours,
the text will not send, and you'll receive an error.
