# Request Form

Texting [assignments](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/text-assignment) can be easily and automatically distributed to texters using the
request form. The request form can be found at the top of a
texter's [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards).

Two steps are required to assign campaign conversations via the
request form:

1. The campaign must have autoassign enabled. This can be
toggled on within the **Autoassign Mode** window of the campaign settings page.

2. Assignments must be enabled from the [**Assignment Control**](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/manage-assignment-control) page of the administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards). From the Assignment Control page, you can decide whether to
release unsent initial messages or unhandled replies. You can
can also set a maximum number of texts that can be requested at
once. Both of these options can be set individually for
different [teams](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/44-teams) of texters, or for all texters at once, using the "General" designation.
