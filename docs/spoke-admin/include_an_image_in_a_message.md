# Include An Image In A Message

You can include images with your messages to send event posters
or other media to your contacts.

Note: Multimedia messages cost more to send than text-only
messages. Ask your organization for guidelines and permission.

**Attaching images in Spoke:**

**In a message, paste a URL between two square
brackets, [ ]. For example:
`[https://image-url.com/image-is-here].`**

Write a message to be sent with the image. Any text before
and after the bracketed URL is combined into a single
message with the bracketed URL removed.

**Example:**

Hey {firstName}, this is {texterFirstName} with ORGANIZATION. URGENT
FACT. That is why we are organizing to X. Will you stand in
solidarity and sign our pledge to Y?

Cellular carriers have different limitations on MMS attachments.
We recommend keeping attachment size below **600 KB** for best results.

Size limitations for the top 4 US carriers are:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Carrier** | **MMS attachment size** |
| AT&T | 1.4 MB |
| Sprint | 1.4 MB |

| Verizon | 0.675 MB |

Media type limitations
----------------------

MMS attachments may be of the following types:

* image/jpeg
* image/png
* image/gif
* video/3gpp
* video/mp4

Send an image with links
------------------------

The SMS/MMS protocol, regardless of provider, does not support
hyperlinked images. If you want to provide a link with an
accompanying image, you can add [meta tags for social media](https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/) to the linked website itself, and then send the link. These tags
let messaging applications show a preview of the linked content.
For example, this is how YouTube link previews are displayed.

If you don't have control of the linked website, you can create
an intermediate page that redirects to the destination page
[using a refresh tag](https://www.lifewire.com/meta-refresh-tag-3469046). Then, you can add meta tags to the intermediate page.
