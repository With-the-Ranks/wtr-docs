# Text Assignment

Assignments are discrete batches of text messages
(conversations) to be allocated to texters. There are two
different ways to assign conversations to texters: manually or
automatically.

Manual Assignment
-----------------

Administrators can manually assign texts to individual texters
from either the **Texters**window of the campaign
settings page or from the **Message Review** page off
of the administration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards). Depending on how many texters you are managing with manual
assignment, this can be a very time-intensive process. We
typically recommend using auto-assignment, unless you have a
special case that requires manual assignment.

Auto-Assignment
---------------

[Auto-assignment](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment) allows texters to request a preset number of conversations (either
initial messages or unhandled replies) from the [request form](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form) on the texter [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

Auto-assignment can be set up two different ways:

1. **Approval Required:**Where each assignment
   request must be manually approved by an Administrator or [Supervolunteer](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/6-user-roles) in order for texters to receive their texts.
2. **Auto Approve:**Where requested assignments
   are automatically approved, allowing texters to start
   texting contacts within moments of submitting their request.

Determine the default setting for auto-assignment in the **Settings** page of the administration dashboard.

To expedite the assignment process, we typically recommend
setting the default to Auto Approve. You can also edit
the auto-assignment setting of a specific texter in
the **People** page
of the administration dashboard.

Once you've set the default setting for auto-assignment, you can
enable autoassign for specific campaigns within the **Autoassign Mode** window of the campaign settings page. You can then
release texting assignments from those campaigns to your texters
via the [request form](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form), using the [**Assignment Control**](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/66-manage-assignment-control) page of the administration dashboard.
