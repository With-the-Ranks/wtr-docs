# Script Preview

Script preview allows you to see a campaign's [interaction script](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/38-interaction-scripts) and [canned responses](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/47-canned-responses) in a clean and organized format. This can be helpful to have open
on a separate tab as you build your campaigns, if you need to share
your campaign with another team member to get feedback or approval
on a script, or if you want to give your texters a more holistic
view of the campaign they're working on.

##### *To access the script preview for a campaign:*

1. Select the campaign from the **Campaigns**page
of theadministration [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

2. Click **Open Script Preview**. This will
automatically open the preview in a new tab in your browser.
