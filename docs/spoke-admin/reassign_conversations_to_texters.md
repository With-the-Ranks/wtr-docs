# Reassign Conversations To Texters

There are several ways for you to reassign conversations to new
texters or to unassign conversations to release them back to the
assignment pool. The following sections describe the various
methods of reassignment and unassignment.

From the Message Review page
----------------------------

From the Message Review page, you can manually reassign (or
unassign) conversations to different texters.

To reassign conversations from the message review page:

1. Go to the **Message Review** page from the administration
   dashboard.
2. Filter the message list from the **Message** **Filter** window. Using the filter gives you the
   option of reassigning all conversations that match the filter.
3. Find the conversations you want to reassign, and select them
   with the checkbox.
4. Open the **Message Actions** window.
5. Select **Reassign**.  
      
   > Note: You can also select
   > **Unassign** to release the conversations back
   > into the assignment pool.
6. Specify one or more texters who will receive the
   reassignment.
7. Click **Reassign selected** to reassign all selected
   contacts or **Reassign all *n* matching** to reassign all contacts that match the filter.

Example of how you assign initial messages (Needs First
Message), from a specific campaign, that are currently
unassigned.

From the
**Escalated Convos** page of the administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards), you can manually reassign (or unassign) escalated

      you the option of reassigning all escalated conversations
      that match the filter.
   2. Manually find the conversations you want to
      reassign, and select them with the checkbox.
3. Open the **Message Actions** window.
4. Select **Reassign**.  
      
   > Note: You can also select
