# Organizations

An
**organizatio****n** is a distinct sending
identity within your Spoke instance. Each instance of Spoke
Rewired can have multiple organizations.

Organizations can be useful if your texting goals are different
enough to keep separate. For example, there may be overlap
between a volunteer contact list and a voter contact list. If
you send out both volunteer information and voter information,
your volunteers would receive both conversations from the same
sending number, creating a single thread in their inbox. If you
create one organization for volunteers and another organization
for voters, your volunteer could receive information from you
through two distinct sending numbers, thus separating those
conversations distinct threads.

Each organization is defined by a number, which is visible in
the URL of both
[dashboards](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

##### *Each organization has a separate:*

* Pool of phone numbers for sending messages
* Opt-out list\*

> \*Note: If you wish to have instance-wide, rather than
> organization-wide, opt outs, please contact
> [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

#### User Permissions Across Organizations

Any user designated as a
**Superadmin** will be added to all new
organizations as an **Owner.** This can be useful if
you plan to manage many organizations on a shared Spoke instance.
Superadmin status must be managed directly in the database. Please
contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if this is something you'd like
to set up.
