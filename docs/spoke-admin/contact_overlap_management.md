# Contact Overlap Management

When you [upload a contact list](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/contact-lists) to a new campaign, Spoke automatically detects overlapping contacts
with previous campaigns. **Contact Overlap Management** allows you to review and delete these overlapping contacts so that
you can avoid interrupting existing conversations and not over-text
your contacts. Typically, it's best to delete overlapping contacts
from recent campaigns.

For each previous campaign listed in the Contact Overlap
Management window, you'll see:

* **Overlap Count:** the number of
  overlapping contacts between the previous campaign and new
  campaign
* **ID:** the ID number of the previous
  campaign
* **Last Message:** the last time at least
  one overlapping contact was messaged
* **Title:**the name of the previous
  campaign

##### *To identify and delete overlapping contacts:*

1. Select the **Contact Overlap Management** window
   within the campaigns settings page.
2. Review the campaigns that have overlapping contacts with the
   new campaign.
3. Click the checkboxes that correspond to the rows of
   overlapping contacts you wish to delete.
4. Click **Delete Selected**.
