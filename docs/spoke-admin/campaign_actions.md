# Campaign Actions

You can manage active [campaigns](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/campaigns) with campaign actions. The following actions are available for
each campaign as viewed on the **Campaigns**page of
the administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards). You can access these options by clicking the three vertical
dots to the right of each campaign.

### 

### Release Unsent Messages

##### Unassigns all conversations waiting for an initial message from a texter.

Texters may not all always send out all the initial messages
assigned to them. When that happens, you can select  **Release Unsent Messages***,*which will make all previously stranded initial
messages available for assignment to other texters via the [request form](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/request-form).

#### Mark For Second Pass

##### Marks all conversations that didn't receive a response from the contact as needing an initial message.

This action is useful for following up with contacts who didn't
see the initial message or who forgot to reply. If you use this
action, you should also change the script's initial message so
that texters don't send the exact same message twice. For
example, you could start the new initial message with, *"Hey `{firstName}`, just wanted to make sure you
saw our first message..."*

When you use this action, a notification displays the number of
conversations that are marked for a second pass. After marking
for a pass, you'll need to **Release Unsent Messages**in order to make them available for assignment via the
request form. [Click here](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/running-a-second-pass) to learn more about running a second pass.

> Note: You can only mark for a second pass before the due date of
> a campaign.

#### Release Unreplied Conversations

##### Unassigns conversations where the contact has replied and is awaiting a response from a texter.

Texters may not finish responding to all their replies before
signing off for the day. Or even if they do, additional replies
may continue to come in from the initial message they've already
sent. In either case, administrators can **Release Unreplied Conversations**in order to grab those conversations out of their
existing workflows and make them available for assignment to
other texters via the request form.

To ensure that you're not ripping away conversations that
texters are actively working on, you must specify the amount of
time conversations have been idle in order to be released.

#### Archive Campaign

##### Stops the campaign, marks it as archived, and disables all future texting and notifications for the campaign.

Use **Archive Campaign** when you're sure you're done
texting on it or if you need to immediately stop all texts from going
out to campaign contacts. You can unarchive archived campaigns.

#### Delete Unmessaged Contacts

##### Removes contacts that have not yet received a message.

Use this action if you don't want to message any more contacts
on a campaign, but you still want to use auto-assignment to
handle replies. For example, you may catch an error in the
initial message or realize you've already passed an important
deadline. In these scenarios, you won't want to keep
sending out incorrect or outdated information, but you'll
still need to handle replies from contacts who already received
the initial message.

#### Un-Mark for Second Pass

##### Marks contacts that have been sent a message but are marked as unmessaged—because they were marked for a second pass—as having been message.

This is effectively an "undo" button for **Mark for Second Pass**. Just as with **Delete Unmessaged Contacts**, you
can use this action if you don't want to message any more
contacts on a campaign, but you still want to use
auto-assignment to handle replies.

#### Turn auto-assign ON/OFF

##### Makes campaign conversations eligible or ineligible for automatic [assignment](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/text-assignment) to texters via the [request form](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/request-form).

This is a shortcut action to toggle auto-assignment on or off, [just as you would](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/request-form) from the campaign settings page.
