# Export For Upload To Van

The "Export for VAN" feature allows you to export survey
responses collected during a Spoke campaign in a format that may
be easier for upload back into VAN.

From the campaign page, **select Export for VAN:**

This will then open the Export for VAN dialog.

Select which field the VAN ID lives in. **If you are using our VAN integration, you should leave the
default of "external\_id".** If you uploaded contacts via a CSV, you'll need to select the heading
of the column in the CSV that contained your VAN IDs. For example,
this could be *van\_id:*

In most cases, you'll only want to include survey responses for
contacts to whom you actually sent a message. However, you have
a choice to include all contacts, regardless of whether or not
they have been messaged. To do so, toggle on *Include unmessaged contacts.*

**After clicking the *Export*button, you'll receive an
email**containing a link to download the export.Â
