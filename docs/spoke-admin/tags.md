# Tags

Tags are used by texters to log additional data about a
conversation or contact. Tags can be applied to any conversation
across all of your organization's campaigns and are typically
used to capture information that doesn't fit neatly in your
interaction scripts.

For example, a
*Spanish* tag would allow you to mark people
replying in Spanish as Spanish-speakers, giving you the
information needed to contact them in the future in their
preferred language. A *Volunteer Lead* would allow
you to mark people expressing interest in volunteering,
enabling you to follow up and recruit them later.

> *Note: Conversation tags apply only to the current
> conversation and do carry over to conversations with the
> same contact on other campaigns.*

##### *To create a tag:*

1. Navigate to the **Tags**page page of the
   administration [dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards).
2. Click the green **plus (+)** button in the
   bottom right-hand corner.
3. Choose a **tag title**.
4. *Optional –*You may also include a **tag description**, a **tag script** that will automatically
   populate when the tag is selected by a texter, as well as the
   tag's**text color** and **background color**.
5. Click **Create**.

#### Custom Escalation Tags

You can also create a custom escalation tag that not only logs
data but removes the conversation from a texter's workflow, and
makes it uniquely available to a specialized [team](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/create-a-team) for assignment. To do this, just un-check **Allow assignment**when creating your tag.

You can then apply these custom escalation tags to a specialized
team of texters by navigating to
**Assignment Control** and  adding the tag to the **Custom escalation tag**field.
