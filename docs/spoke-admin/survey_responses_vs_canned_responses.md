# Survey Responses Vs Canned Responses

One of most common mistakes made by Spoke users is to mix up the
use of
**survey responses** and **canned responses** when building campaign scripts. Using each feature correctly will
ensure that you have easy-to-navigate scripts that log all the data
you want to capture. Using them incorrectly may result in loss of
data and a frustrating experience for your texters.

### Survey Responses

Survey Responses constitute the core building blocks of your
campaigns. Creating survey responses in your
[Interaction Script](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/43-create-interaction-script) allows your texters to select a from a menu of survey responses
while in a texting conversation, each with it's own prepared script.
Once the survey response is selected and sent, the texter is also
simultaneously logging data about how that contact responded. In
other words, **survey responses combine the functions of providing a
ready-made script for your texters and logging data about
the conversation.**Therefore, in order to both log data and make life
easier for your texters, the vast majority of your campaign's
responses should typically be built into your Interaction Script
as survey responses.

For example, if you're asking a Yes/No question in your initial
message, then "Yes," "No," and "Maybe" should all be
different survey responses. Similarly, if you're gauging support
for a candidate using a 1-5 Voter ID score, then you should have
five different survey responses, one for each level of support
(see example survey response scripts
[here](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/120-writing-scripts)). Note that in addition to generating useful scripts for your
texters, it would be critical to capture the data on how
contacts answered these questions.

### Canned Responses

Canned Responses constitute a supplemental menu of common
answers to common questions that your texters may encounter.
Applying a canned response to a conversation does
*not*log any data about that conversation. Therefore, **c****anned responses should *only* be used to answer questions
where you don't care about collecting data.**

Below are some common examples of canned responses. Note that
answering these questions would provide the contact with
important information, but it wouldn't typically be important to
log data indicating that they asked the question.

* Where did you get my information?
* What is {organization_name}?
* How do I check if I'm registered to vote?
* Where is my polling place?
