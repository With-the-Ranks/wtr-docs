# Bulk Script Editor

The **bulk script editor**is a tool that allows you
to simultaneously find and replace parts of your interaction
scripts across multiple campaigns. With this tool, you provide
the text you want to replace and the text you want to replace it
with. The editor searches all campaigns in your organization and
performs the replacement for all interaction scripts.

You can use a filter to restrict the replacement to a smaller
set of campaigns. A filter can restrict the editor to active
campaigns and to campaigns with names that begin with specific
text (this is one reason why having a consistent campaign **naming convention** can be useful).

To use this tool, you must provide the exact text you want to
replace. If your interaction scripts all have slight variations,
the bulk script editor must be used for each variation. Keep
this in mind when writing interaction scripts.

If you leave the **"...****with this text"** field blank, the bulk script editor replaces all instances of the
text with nothing, effectively deleting them.

The bulk script editor works only for a single Spoke [organization](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/organizations). If you have multiple organizations, you must use the bulk
script editor for each one.

> Note: Clicking the
> **Find & Replace** button performs the action without
> confirmation. Click this button only after you've double-checked
> the text, filters, and other options.

After you use the bulk script editor, a notification displays
all instances (or occurrences) of replacement. Once you exit
this notification, you cannot open it again. If you want to save
the details of the replacements, copy them before clicking **OK**.
