# Dashboards

Dashboards are the primary interfaces that administrators and
texters use to navigate Spoke.

following pages:

  you can [create](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/34-create-a-campaign) new campaigns, view campaigns [statuses](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/57-colors-and-tags-for-active-campaigns), and take campaign [actions](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/campaign-actions).
