# Settings

The following settings apply to all campaigns in your Spoke
organization. You can access these **Settings** from
the administrator
[dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards).

Default Text Request Auto-Approval Level
----------------------------------------

Choose the default assignment-approval setting for new
texters.Â To expedite the assignment process, we typically
recommend setting the default to Auto Approve. Though no matter
the default assignment-approval level, you can modify an
individual texter's approval level from the
**People** tab on
the lefthand side admin panel.

Opt-Out Message
---------------

You can set the default opt-out message that auto-populates the
message field when texters use the opt-out feature.

Texting Hours
-------------

You can enforce
[texting hours](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/texting-hours) across all campaigns by turning on this feature. This prevents
you from disturbing contacts outside of these hours. Each campaign
has its own set of texting hours that you specify on the campaign
settings page.

Assemble Numbers API key
------------------------

Assemble Numbers is a service that helps you determine whether
you can reach a phone number in your contact list. This API key
field is populated by default and allows you to use the
*Filter Landlines* feature within the campaign settings page.

Contact Information Display
---------------------------

For some specific use cases (e.g., volunteer or member contact)
it may be desirable to show the contact's last name and/or cell
phone to the texter. The toggles in this section allow you to do
that.
