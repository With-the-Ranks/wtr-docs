# Canned Responses

Canned responses are an additional set of prepared messages that
texters can use if a conversation deviates from the interaction
script. They're typically added to prepare texters to answer
common questions, for example,"How did you get my number?" or
"Will the livestream be recorded?"

##### *To add canned responses to a campaign:*

1. Select theÂ **Canned Responses**window within the campaigns settings page.

4. Write a **Script** for your canned response and
   click **Done**.

> Note: Canned responses do not log survey data. If you want to
> log data associated with a canned response script, it would be
> better to incorporate that script as a survey option or tag.
