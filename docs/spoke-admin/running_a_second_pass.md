# Running A Second Pass

[Second Pass 101: Watch this short demonstration video.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r7TgIOLTZWTMkUsF-KCy7-nCuAyqYeQ-/view)

Running a **second pass** is a great way to politely bump your initial message to
non-responsive contacts. Done well, second passes see high
response rates, save you time, and maintain the integrity of
your data.

To run a second pass:

1. Confirm that all initial messages have been sent. This can be
done from **Message Review** by filtering for the campaign
name and *Contact message status: Needs First Message*.

If you want to run a second pass but have outstanding initials,
you can quickly assign and send them without worry that those
contacts will be "bumped" on the second pass.   
   
If you were to run a second pass *without* ensuring that all
initials had been sent, the first message those outstanding contacts
would receive would be your bump message! You should either confirm
that all first pass initials have been sent or delete unmessaged
contacts before moving to step 2.

2. From the **Basics** tab of the campaign settings
page, update the title of your campaign to indicate that you're running
a second pass. This could entail adding *P2*or *Pass 2* to your campaign title, or swapping one of those out for *P1*or *Pass 1.* For example, your campaign may initial be titled *Phonebank\_P1\_8.26.20*and swapped to *Phonebank\_P2\_8.26.20*before
running a second pass.  
   
From the **Interactions** tab of the campaign settings
page, replace your initial message with second pass language. Best
practices when crafting a second pass initial include removing *{}*texterFirstName** and both shortening and reiterating your previous
message.   
   
For example, for an initial message that read *"Hi `{firstName}`, it's `{texterFirstName}`
with CANDIDATE! Election Day is one week away and it's all
hands on deck to get CANDIDATE elected. Will you join us for
a phonebank on DAY at TIME and help us reach every voter in
DISTRICT?"*you may consider a second pass like, *"Hi `{firstName}`, just wanted to make sure you saw
our first message! Can you join Team CANDIDATE for a
phonebank on DAY at TIME?"*

3. From the **Campaigns** page of the administration
[dashboard](https://withtheranks.com/docs/spoke/for-spoke-admins/dashboards), select the three dots to the right of the campaign name.

Choose **Mark for a Second Pass** from the
pop-up menu.

2. Determine a window of time to mark previously-messaged
contacts. You can indicate both a number of days and a number of
hours that have passed since a contact has last been messaged.
It is a best practice to mark for a second pass when a contact
has been messaged 16 hours ago or later; this gives contacts
enough time to see and respond to your message and prevents
oversaturation. If you choose to toggle off "exclude recently
texted contacts," all contacts who have not yet responded will
be marked for a second pass.

3. Determine if you'd like to exclude contacts who are present
on a newer campaign, regardless of whether or not they have
received a message yet. Toggling off "exclude contacts uploaded
on a newer campaign" will mark all contacts who have not yet
responded for a second pass, even if they are loaded on a
campaign with a higher ID number.

4. After executing the operation, you will see the number of
contacts that have been marked for a second pass. It is typical
for this number to be 80-90% of your initial list size,
depending on the window of time that you've set.

5. From the same three dot menu to the right of the campaign,
use the popup menu to select **Release Unsent Messages.** Skipping this step would mean leaving newly unsent
messages in the workflows of the original senders, therefore
preventing you from assigning those texts from the request
form.

6. Confirm that your campaign is on Autoassign and that the
request form is set to Initial Messages, or manually assign the
new initial messages in Message Review!
