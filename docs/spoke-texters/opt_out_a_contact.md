# Opt Out A Contact

Opting out a contact adds them to your organization's opt-out
list. This prevents you from sending more messages to the
contact. All future campaigns automatically remove contacts who
are on the opt-out list.

> Note: Opt-outs are permanent. Please make sure to ask your
> administrator about which conversations you should opt out and
> which you should not.

your organization.
