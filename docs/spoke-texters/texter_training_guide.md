This training will teach you to navigate Spoke Rewired, our peer-to-peer
text messaging tool. Spoke is a powerful web-based texting platform that
allows you to do rapid outreach to mobilize your members, turn out
voters, build your base, and more.

When texting with Spoke, you have two goals:

1. Engage contacts efficiently and thoughtfully
2. Log accurate data according to contacts' responses

These goals are equally important, and we’ll explain how they fit into
the Spoke workflow in the Sending Responses section. We recommend
reviewing each section of this training guide to prepare for your first
texting shift.

Welcome!

  

TEXTING IN SPOKE REWIRED
========================

### SENDING INITIAL TEXTS

Whether using your computer, tablet, or smartphone, sending text
messages in Spoke is quick and easy. When beginning your texting shift,
you should do the following:

1. Start by checking your team's texting guide and any announcements or
   instructions from your texting leaders.
2. Create your account. Your texting leaders will send you a link that
   will invite you to your texting workspace. Once your account setup is
   complete, you will either see a text request form or a message
   indicating that no texts are available. If you see *Ready to text?*and the green [*Request More Texts* button](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/41-request-texts), you can request your first assignment!Your texting
   leaders have set the maximum amount of texts you can request per
   batch; feel free to start smaller while you are getting to know the
   system, but know that batch sizes smaller than 300 are unlikely to
   provide many immediate replies!![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fJpk4sFOteu0_LTwa7kDuDmi-FtWBi1TQUq4lupQvAgPOrlKHN7W6zCryp_Y9w68pMlyTo_JagI3xaU7_rJoPp-7kfQzAAMnicoShExDZ3Hmu4p0huAyZNMsDuhHdrlc1mrpg1CL)
3. Once your text request has been approved, you will see your
   first assignment. Click on *SEND FIRST TEXTS* to enter the
   conversation screen. The green bubble indicates the number of texts
   you’ve been assigned.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/5f46cdeb042863444aa0e370/file-BZCsHF3M5d.png)
4. From the conversation screen, the initial text is provided for you.
   You will not be able to edit this first message. [Send messages](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/36-send-texts) by clicking the *SEND* button in the lower left or by tapping
   the enter key on your keyboard. We recommend sending all of your initial
   messages before fielding your replies!

   ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f3fa3980fd5a31e7ad103e/file-12jw0Jse44.png)

### RESPONDING TO REPLIES

After sending your first assignment, you can begin [responding to contacts' replies](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/36-send-texts). Recipients will respond over time, sometimes hours or even days later
— Aim to check your workflow for replies a few times throughout
the day to ensure everyone who responds to your initial text receives a
reply from you.

1. As replies come into your workflow, you’ll see a *SEND REPLIES* button appear. The number in the orange bubble indicates the
   number of replies that need your attention. Unless you need to reopen
   a conversation that has already taken place, feel free to disregard
   the *PAST MESSAGES* or *SKIPPED MESSAGES*section.
   Any messages in the *SEND LATER* bucket will reopen when
   it reaches 9am in those contacts' local time zone.   
      
    **Note:** Conversations will only appear in your workflow
   between 9am-9pm local time for the recipients. If outside of that window,
   you will not be able to respond to contacts until texting hours reopen.
   Inbound replies from your contacts will appear the next morning. 
   ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/5f4918192c7d3a352e917fb7/file-6IcsLsHrWf.png)
2. After clicking the *SEND REPLIES*button, you’ll see the first
   reply in your queue. See the following section for instructions on
   marking the survey according to contacts' responses. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f3fb0b61ff5d5f24f9abc5/file-qet697zecs.png)

   ### MARKING SURVEY RESPONSES

Remember: Engaging in a positive conversation with your contacts is
equally important to logging accurate data for your campaign or
organization. When responding, first ask: Which survey response most
accurately captures their response to my question?

Click on the survey question below *Current question*

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f3fcd06d67192dc61b9aed/file-mXV00jGdhf.png)

Read all responses carefully to ensure that your choice most accurately
reflects their response. For example, note that the survey below
includes two distinct options for wrong numbers, *Wrong number* and *Wrong number / Supports CANDIDATE*. You would
want to choose the latter if the recipient had responded "This is not
Adelaide, but I love CANDIDATE! They have my vote!"

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4000b829a3853b69257fb/file-yKxsQOVPZx.png)

If a contact clearly and explicitly asks to no longer receive texts, you
must immediately [opt them out](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/73-opt-out-a-contact).

**Common opt-out responses:**

* “Lose my number.”
* “Remove me.”
* “Don’t text me.”
* “Take me off your list.”
* “Unsubscribe.”

Opt Outs are a system feature that prevents your team from ever
contacting that phone number again. Follow the instructions of your
texting leaders, but do not opt contacts out unless they clearly ask to
be removed.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f401ea4181f8597e7d1402/file-tEOTn7QSw4.png)

To opt a contact out, use the orange *OPT OUT* button at the
bottom of your screen. An *unsubscribed* message will pre-populate;
click send to complete the opt out. To opt a contact out without sending
a message, delete the prepopulated response and hit *Opt out without sending message.*This is recommended if the contact responds with something like, "I
better not receive one more message from you!" but it is best practice
and highly recommended to send the *unsubscribed* notification.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4035a6d67192dc61b9b22/file-2keiIKU8jJ.png)

Sometimes the contact asks a question rather than directly responding to
the initial message. If possible, mark the survey response accurately
but tailor the message to address their question. To find suggested
replies to common questions, check [the CANNED RESPONSES section](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/74-use-canned-response) to the right of the *OPT OUT* button.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4043e80fd5a31e7ad106e/file-pO5AutvG4b.png)

Clicking on a canned response will automatically populate the message
field. If the contact has not addressed the initial question and it
feels appropriate to do so, you could use a canned response and then
reiterate the initial ask.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f405bb6d67192dc61b9b2f/file-Cgqk8XGCNr.png)

### APPLYING TAGS

In addition to survey responses, data can also be captured through the [application of tags](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/58-add-tags-to-a-conversation).

Tags are commonly used to:

* Indicate that the recipient speaks another language.
* Escalate a conversation to another team or texting leader.
* Log data that doesn't naturally fit into the script, e.g. *I want a yard sign!*

To apply a tag, click *MANAGE TAGS* at the bottom of your screen.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4072e6d67192dc61b9b3f/file-WhAI0wz53P.png)

In the example above, tagging "Spanish" would allow your texting leader
to reach out to that contact in their first language the next time around.
Depending on your program, you may also have the ability to tag *"*Reassign to Spanish Speaker" and actually pass that conversation to a
Spanish-speaking teammate — just by applying the tag!

To find a tag, place your cursor under *Apply tags* and begin typing. The list will filter to the available tags
as you begin typing.

When the tag appears, select it and click *SAVE*.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4178c61ff5d5f24f9ac9b/file-6xNFCR7pIT.png)

From the *MANAGE TAGS* section, you also have the option to [escalate a conversation](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/81-escalate-a-conversation) directly to your texting leaders. This button should be used with
care and according to your team's specific instructions. Texting programs
often use this button to transfer messages directly to administrators because
they contain:

* Threats of violence
* Deadnaming, i.e. when a contact identifies as trans or non-binary but
  your organization's data contains their old, dead name
* Urgent requests. e.g. a canvassing volunteer who is having trouble
  finding an event location

  ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4181e829a3853b692588f/file-jA2p8rLEnA.png)

  In general, you should only escalate as the final recourse to an
  extremely sensitive or urgent conversation.

### NAVIGATING CONVERSATIONS

If a voter sends a message that doesn’t require a response, you [can simply select CLOSE](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/80-close-conversation)*,*next to the *MANAGE TAGS* button. This
essentially marks the message as “read” and will move it out of your *SEND REPLIES* section and into your *SKIPPED MESSAGES*.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4192f80fd5a31e7ad1112/file-hVwqa6Ywu9.png)

To leave a reply "unread" so you can come back to it later, you should
instead use the NEXT **>** button on the
bottom right of your screen. Unlike the *CLOSE*button,
this will allow you to continue working on other replies and easily
come back to an unanswered conversation.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4199661ff5d5f24f9acae/file-PLIdD0Ft4R.png)

### 

### 

When texting on behalf of a campaign or organization, you should
consider what each message you send would look like if it appeared
on social media without context. Would it reflect well on the program
you're supporting? Would other volunteers be proud to say they work
alongside you? When responding to sensitive, unpleasant, or triggering
messages, ask yourself: “What would it look like if my text conversation
went viral?”

### ENGAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES

|
|  |

Almost every text list will put you in touch with non-supporters or even
trolls who use offensive language to try to bait you into saying
something you’d regret. To safeguard ourselves against this, here are a
few tips to help when you find yourself in a heated situation:

1. Disengage: Take a break from texting by walking away from your screen
   to recenter yourself around the goal of your work. Taking a breather
   can help you collect your thoughts and refocus.
2. Lean on survey responses: Make use of the pre-scripted responses to
   quickly move past negative responders and onto potential supporters.
3. Reach out to texting leadership: Don't hesitate to ask for help
   from your teammates and leadership. They can help you craft a
   thoughtful response or even take a conversation off your hands.
