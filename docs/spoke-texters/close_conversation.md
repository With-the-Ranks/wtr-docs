Close Conversation
------------------

Closing a reply allows you to move onto the next conversation
without sending a reply to a contact. You can return to
conversations that you skipped using the **Skipped Messages** button on the texter dashboard.

##### *To close a reply:*

* From a conversation, click **Close**, as shown here:

> **Note:** if you want to temporarily skip a conversation
> and immediately come back to it, it may be easier to click theÂ 
> **"NEXT >"**button on the far right side of your
> control panel, rather than Close. This will simply place the
> conversation at the end of your existing workflow, instead of
> moving it to the Skipped Messages category.
