3. Input your email and click "Request Reset." This reset
   request could take up to 15 minutes. Navigate to your email
   to open the password reset link. You will then be able to
   reset your password and access Spoke. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/634eef20de258f5018eb56ba/file-12eY11EtWe.png)

#### Cannot Find Reset Email

If you have not received the password reset link, look to
see whether you may have registered on Spoke using a different
email address. This is a common error. Search for
"support@withtheranks.com" in all of your email addresses to
identify the email with an active spoke account.

If you find messages from Spoke Rewired in another email
address, navigate to your Spoke webpage and restart the above
process with the correct email address. Once you have opened the
password reset link and have access to spoke, you can change
your email address by clicking the gray bubble with your initial
in the top right hand corner and then clicking on your name.
This will bring you to the account settings page.

If you have further questions or difficulties updating your
account info, email [support@withtheranks.com](mailto:support@withtheranks.com) for further
assistance. In your email, please indicate the URL of the Spoke
page you are attempting to access.
