# Send Texts

After you have [requested](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/41-request-texts-for-assignment) and received an assignment, you can begin texting contacts.

Sending Initial Messages
------------------------

##### *To send your initial messages:*

1. Open the texter [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).
2. Click **Send First Texts**.
3. Click **Send**until you run out of initial
   messages.  
      
   > Note: You cannot edit the initial message.

Following these steps will take the conversations out of your
workflow. When contacts begin responding, the conversations will
reappear under the **Send Replies** category.

Sending Replies
---------------

##### *To send replies to contacts who have responded to an initial message:*

1. Open the texter [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).
2. Click **Send Replies**.
3. Answer the survey question by clicking below **Current Question** and selecting a survey option. This will automatically populate
   a prepared response.
4. *Optional* – Edit the message as needed. We recommend
   using the response that your Spoke administrators have carefully
   crafted for you. Think about personalizing the message if the
   contact asked a direct question or shared something personal
   with you.
5. Click **Send**.

Handling replies will take those conversations out of your
workflow, but they'll remain visible on your dashboard as **Past Messages**.

This is the standard procedure for sending replies. However, in
certain cases, you might need to add a tag, opt out a contact,
escalate a conversation, use a canned response, or close the
conversation. Please see the **Related Articles** below to learn more about these topics.
